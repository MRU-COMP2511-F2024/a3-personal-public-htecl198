            <h2>Artifact 3: Mock Gaming PC Website</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Objective:</strong> This project focused on designing and developing a multi-page website for a mock gaming PC company. 
                It demonstrates proficiency in HTML, CSS, and web design principles, with a strong emphasis on usability, accessibility, and aesthetics.
            </p>

            <h3>Highlights</h3>
            <p>
                The website consists of three main pages: Home, Products, and Contact Us. Each page is designed with a consistent layout and navigational structure. 
                Below are some of the key features:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Responsive navigation bar that indicates the current page using CSS pseudo-classes.</li>
                <li>A visually appealing product table with alternating row colors and detailed product descriptions.</li>
                <li>A "Contact Us" form with input validation, placeholder examples, and required fields to enhance user experience.</li>
                <li>Accessibility-focused design, including descriptive `alt` attributes for images and a clean semantic structure.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Design Principles</h3>
            <p>
                This project applied Gestalt principles such as proximity, alignment, and contrast to ensure a professional and user-friendly design. For example:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related navigation links are grouped together, making it easy for users to find what they need.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Consistent margins and padding across pages create a polished layout.</li>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Clear distinctions between text and background improve readability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Challenge:</strong> Ensuring responsive design for different screen sizes.  
                <br><strong>Solution:</strong> Used CSS flexbox and percentage-based widths to create a layout that adjusts seamlessly to various devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Challenge:</strong> Keeping the design visually consistent across pages.  
                <br><strong>Solution:</strong> Created a global CSS file for shared styles and page-specific CSS for unique elements.
            </p>

            <h3>Workflow and Learning Outcomes</h3>
            <p>
                This project enhanced my understanding of creating professional websites from scratch using only HTML and CSS. 
                I learned how to structure a website semantically, implement responsive navigation, and create user-friendly forms. 
                Through this project, I also gained insights into how design principles can improve website usability and engagement.

            <p>The product table showcases my ability to organize data efficiently while implementing design principles like alternating row colors for better readability.</p>
