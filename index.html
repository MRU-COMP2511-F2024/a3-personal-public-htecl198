            <p>Hello and welcome to my ePortfolio! My name is Heron, and I’m currently a second-year student pursuing a degree in Computer Information Systems. I'm passionate about technology, coding, and web design, and I’m constantly seeking new ways to apply what I’ve learned to real world projects.</p>
            <p>Throughout my studies, I’ve developed a strong foundation in coding languages like Java, HTML, CSS, and Python, and I’ve honed my skills in creating functional, user friendly websites and applications. In this portfolio, you'll find some of my key projects that showcase my growth as a developer, as well as my problem solving skills and attention to detail.</p>
            <p>When I’m not coding, you can find me playing sports, watching games, or often debating the latest in sports news. Whether it’s discussing strategies or analyzing player stats, my love for sports keeps me engaged in the world of competition and teamwork—skills that I also bring into my tech projects.</p>
            <p>I’m excited to continue exploring the vast world of technology and to keep improving both my technical and creative abilities. Thank you for taking the time to explore my work. If you have any questions or want to connect, feel free to reach out through the contact page.</p>
