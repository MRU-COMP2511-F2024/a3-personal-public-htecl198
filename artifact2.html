            <h2>Artifact 2: Federal Skilled Worker Program Applicant Screening</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Objective:</strong> This project focused on developing a Python application to assess eligibility for the Federal Skilled Worker Program. 
                It evaluates applicant scores across multiple criteria, such as language proficiency and work experience, using modular programming techniques.
            </p>

            <h3>Testing Section</h3>
            <p>
                A significant part of this project was creating unit tests to validate the correctness of scoring functions. Below is a screenshot of the 
                **testing logic** that ensures the scoring functions for both language proficiency and work experience are accurate and robust:

                <figcaption>Screenshot: Python testing section for scoring functions.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
            <p>
                One challenge was ensuring that the scoring algorithms accurately reflected the real-world Federal Skilled Worker Program guidelines. 
                Debugging edge cases, such as applicants with zero years of work experience or varying language levels, required careful attention to detail.
            </p>
            <p>
                I overcame these challenges by writing unit tests for each function, which allowed me to identify and fix errors early in development. 
                By iterating through several test cases, I ensured the program was both accurate and reliable.
            </p>

            <h3>Workflow and Learning Outcomes</h3>
            <p>
                This project reinforced my knowledge of modular programming and file I/O in Python. By breaking down functionality into smaller reusable components, 
                I was able to build a clear and maintainable codebase. Testing edge cases improved my understanding of writing reliable programs. 
                This experience has significantly boosted my problem-solving skills and confidence in applying programming concepts to real-world applications.
